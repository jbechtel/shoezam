The project consists of three parts: 

1. zap_scrap: a web scraping tool built using Selenium and BeautifulSoup,
2. ShoeClassifier: a pretrained Keras deep convolutional neural net which identifies similarity between an input image, and an image of a shoe in the database,
3. the web app which includes the dash/flask frontend

This app was created during an Insight Data Science Fellowship: Learn more about the project [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSpu7ZLJOo6HCRcoAHAN1GuuPua3CiNy0rs9pSPZ-oJzf35xHKOVPT5lzDXd93siv1p_PU4zC9RXgjZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000#slide=id.g431b499982_0_28)
